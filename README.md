# RNA-KG-Link-Prediction
Several embedding techniques have been proposed in the last few years for creating a vectorial
representation of heterogeneous graphs that rely on the use of graph neural networks and random
walks. The embedding representation is then exploited for predicting the plausibility of new links
that can be included in the heterogeneous graph. Purpose of this Thesis is to compare different
embedding techniques as well as GNN-based techniques in the context of RNA-KG, a recently
proposed RNA-centered knowledge graph with more than 12.7 million edges representing different
kinds of relationships in which RNA molecules can be involved.
The objective of this Thesis is to evaluate the efficiency of graph representation learning (GRL)
techniques, including both non-neural and neural models, for tasks such as link prediction and node
classification.
